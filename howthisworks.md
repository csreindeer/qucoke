# how does this work btw
 Init.go inits the OS as well as reads the output
 OSrunner.sh just allows to use python
 priority.py will soon have the ability to do resource management
 qpuroot.py runs root commands on qubits
 qpustandard.py runs standard commands on qubits
 clc has one qubit, runs different programs, much like bash
 will allow for abstraction

 This is co cpu/qpu, I hope to move this to only qpu sometime in the distant future

 A Way to contribute is by making programs for basic task and a front end for them.
